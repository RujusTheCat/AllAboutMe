  <p>Grade 6 was solid, for the most part. And also, i got circumcised during the summer of 23. I couldnt walk for the entire summer. Grade 7 was the most eventful grade, quite literally, and also the most PEAK for me. I met new friends. At the start, i made friends with some guys by playing terraria and having a common interest, but during the second quarter, Our environmental science teacher had assigned seats, this was REALLY important because i say next to a girl i'll call her "JK". JK was the most extroverted person i could ever see in this class, when next to a reserved introvert, they would best friends. Me and JK talked a lot, even had fun, she was my new best friend who also introduced me to her group which made me more friends. It was the best.</p>
  <p>There was another group in our class called the SS who would cause a lot of drama. Okay, im gonna start a new arc about me getting a crush on this guy. I pretty much knew i was gay. So back at the start of grade 7, this guy, lets call him "Drick". He caught my attention because he was much more fit than the other students. The first interaction i remember with him is telling me he'd fuck me. And having a gooner mind, i was into it? pretty horrendous right? But like, shit, i couldnt stop thinking about him, like our interactions feel so.. intimate for some reason. He would ask me why i keep looking at him, he'd kiss me on the cheek, he would hold my hand, and sometimes be close to me, like my god WHAT THE FUCK AM I EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW? Not to mention, this guy was pretty homophobic, back then. as of now, he's not anymore and pretty supportive. </p>
  <p>But damn, i fell head over heels for this man despite all of the red flags appearing next to him. Well at one point we didnt have any interactions for the rest of the quarter and i was sad, but that meant i was getting over him. During science camp, he went shirtless and i couldnt stop staring. Its crazy. There was this one rumor where he tickled his pickle when everyone else was sleeping, i dont know if it was true. Anyways, about the dramas, Our GC with 11 members reduced to 6 members because the gc got leaked to our teacher. We were interviewed and also a friend had their gay porn leaked to their family. And also most of the people hated this girl "Angela" because she was really annoying and also hated this guy "Black" because he was black and annoying.</p>
  <p>So, Summer. I went swimming with my friends and did jackshit for the rest of the break. Now for grade 8, during the first-second quarter i was STILL in love with Drick. This time, i was less quiet and could hold a conversation for a while. One time we could actually talk to each other and i loved it. I think he did the most to me this time. He grabbed my ass, my dick and we interacted more than usual, but then a fucking typhoon came. Classes shut down for like 2 whole months! The worst part of the typhoon was when we were trying to move the washing machine, and i was being crawled all over by bugs. it was horrifying, and the washing machine even fell over later. It was pointless.</p>
  <p>I was basically rotting the whole time. But early before that. An unexpected person chatted me. It started as normal, but i started flirting with him, then he flirted back. As the butterfly effect goes, we sort of.. fell in love with eachother. Yep. But then shortly after that then the typhoon basically. I just played board games with some random boarders through it all, then when the calm came, i went out and i saw him walking with chlamydia, we hung out. That was start of our intimacy.</p
  <p>i was like whatevvaaaaa like nyaaaaaa ngh </p>
