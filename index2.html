  <h3>Basically, my life.</h3>
  <p class="small_text">(Note: This may contain trauma dumping)</p>
  <p>I was born in a family with 2 older brothers, and one older sister. I'm basically the youngest in my family. Being the youngest, i usually cried extensively. whether it was my phone being taken away and not getting what i want, This is really how i used to act before, weird right? a lot has happened since then.</p>
  <p>I was, an academic achiever during grades 1-3, i would usually get first place, oh how the gifted child i was. I had pretty solid friends. I'll give them a nickname: Marty and Sean, i think thats pretty different enough from their real names.</p>
  <p>They were my "BFFs". We used to play a lot, laugh a lot and have pretty funny moments. However my stupid fucking dipshit attitude of a toddler i was, for some reason i disliked "Marty" for playing FPS games and being rich. i know, i'm a shitty friend. but we talked and i "forgave" him in which hes supposed to forgive ME but that just happened over and over again.</p>
  <p>Then, the pandemic struck everyone. School shut down and... i lost friends. The pandemic really affected the jolly child i was back then. Though i still saw Marty because i used to go to church but when he tried interacting with me, I IGNORED HIM, LIKE WHY?????? WHY??? WHY DID I DO THAT BACK THEN??? SERIOUSLY?? HOLY SHIT I WOULD'VE BEEN HAPPIER.</p>
  <p>When i became really lonely, i started thinking about death. And i was only 10 years old at the time. Like i started thinking about how everyone dies and shit, like imagine, one day your loved ones are gonna die and you'll be there to experience it, that shit really sucked the life out of me. and henceforth, the reason why i suck at socializing now.</p>
  <p>One time, when i was sick, i cried at the thought of my mother dying, shes 50+ years old now. and i couldn't just bare the thought of her soul floating away in the near future. Well, thats when i became desensitized to death, and realized that this... memento mori i've been experiencing, is just pointless. My existential crisis faded away soon after. And i pretty much accepted that death is inevitable and yadda yadda. Thats also the reason why im an Atheist or an Absurdist. Whatever the fuck fits my profile.</p>
  <p>The pandemic ended soon after that, i went into grade 5, and uhm, it was pretty boring. Basically nothing ever happened so lets just move on to grade 6. Oh boy grade 6. Grade 6 is where i'll meet some of the people in my life who've made me happier. But at the start, I.. was suicidal, basically, suicidal in the terms where i always used to think about ending my life, not actually doing it. i had suicidal thoughts. Because majority of the time in grade 6, i was a loner. Nobody wanted to be friends with me. except, for a few people, i really value them. Like this one girl who used to have a crush on me, lets call her "Kilometers", she didnt know i was gay. Trust me i also didnt know i was gay back then, so i was clueless to why this girl wanted to be my friend.</p>
  <p>She gave me gifts, and we were also coincidentally learning japanese at the same time too. Yeah i really wanted to learn another language. I bought a japanese book from naga and started reading at the science park, i thought nobody would care but some people would. They would talk to me sometimes but not really becoming friends. The type of people i would prefer to be friends with are people that can speak english with me, because i dont know fucking shit about talking in tagalog, and im an outcast because i also dont know rinconada. Though i wasnt THAT much of a loner, because i had a friend that i'd call "Smirk". I hope these names are ambiguous enough so people dont know who im talking about.</p>
